Hi everyone!

this is game Wordle done by me with help from Net Ninja and with few additional features; for now it's: 
- polish language compatibility (around 40 words in database)
- possibility to use virtual keyboard (to be mobile friendly)

Project is still WIP, which means that code is not 100% (i.e. comments with console.logs and notes)

You can check it here: https://hanysisko.github.io/wordle-react/

Have fun!
